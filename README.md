# Step-by-Step guide to trigger your Selenium tests using Accessibility Tool

## Prerequisites

- Your [LambdaTest Username and Access key](/support/docs/using-environment-variables-for-authentication-credentials/)
- Setup your local machine as per your testing framework.

### Step 1: Setup Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

```bash
git clone <URL_OF_THE_REPO>
```

If you are using your own project, make sure you update the **Hub endpoint** in your tests file. By setting up the Hub endpoint, you establish the communication channel between your tests and the browser nodes, enabling effective test distribution and execution.

Configure the desired capabilities based on your test requirements. For example:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); # If this cap isn't specified, it will just get the any available one
capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
```

> You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt ðŸ”— [Capabilities Generator Tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).

### Step 2: Establish User Authentication

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

For Linux/macOS

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Step 3: Configure the Necessary Capabilities

To enable the accessibility testing within your automated test suite, set the `accessibility: true` in your configuration file. You can also define other settings capabilities as described below.

```java
capability.setCapability("accessibility", true); // Enable accessibility testing
capability.setCapability("accessibility.wcagVersion", "wcag21a"); // Specify WCAG version (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A)
capability.setCapability("accessibility.bestPractice", false); // Exclude best practice issues from results
capability.setCapability("accessibility.needsReview", true); // Include issues that need review
```

### Step 4: Execute and Monitor your Test

Now execute your tests and visit the [Automation Dashboard](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard). Click on the Accessibility tab and check the report generated.

```bash
mvn test
```
